# Face Tracking using Python
This repo includes a python face tracking algorithm communicating with an arduino to  move a 4-DOF robotic arm to center the human face in the picture frame.

Aruino sketch manages the communication between face detection algorithm and Arduino Uno R3 to move a 4-DOF humanoic arm actuated by servo motors

python libraries are in [pip commands.txt](https://github.com/omargkandil/Face-Tracking-using-Python/blob/main/Python-face-tracking/pip%20commands.txt).
